# Image-Based-Cyberbully-Detection-using-MachineLearning-DeepLearning
A Hybrid Machine learning/Deep Learning project for detecting cyberbullying images on social media using EfficientNetB3 for feature extraction, combined with SVM and XGBoost in a stacking ensemble model. The model includes preprocessing with CLAHE, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and deployment via Gradio interface.
